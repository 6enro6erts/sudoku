# README for sudoku

assumptions: solve reads an input grid with fscanf. All whitespace will be ignored, only the first 81 numbers will be read, and any non integer characters will cause the immediate termination of the program.

Create generates a board with at least 40 zeros and a unique solution. More or less can be added by adjusting the code.
